# APPLYING CNN FOR IMGAE DENOISING AND IMAGE COLORIZATION

## INTRODUCE
we perform the study of  image denoising and image colorization method based on deep learning. Advanced convolutional neural network models have been used effectively.

## COMPATIBILITY
* Python 2.x
* Anaconda
* Tensorflow 2.x
* CUDA + CuDNN

## USE
### Train
* python generate_patches.py
* python main.py

### Test
* python main.py --phase test
